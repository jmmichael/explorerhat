Now, let's learn a little about Explorer HAT. It has:

* 4 inputs, which accept up to 5 volts
* 4 outputs, which sink up to 5 volts to ground
* 4 LEDs; Yellow, Red, Blue and Green
* 8 touch inputs, 4 are fruit compatible

If you have an Explorer HAT Pro, you'll also find:

* 2 Motor outputs, for making robots!
* 4 Analog Inputs for reading sensors, sliders and stuff
